In this task, you will continue practicing with strings and applying different methods to them.

Many things in the world consist of several words. We want to create the `makeAbbr()` method that returns the abbreviations for them.

Will you help us?

For example:
```kotlin
makeAbbr("national aeronautics space administration")
// "NASA"

makeAbbr("central processing unit")
// "CPU"

makeAbbr("simplified molecular input line entry specification")
// "SMILES"
```
